## Web Design for Data Visualization - Weather Data 
### Overview

An analysis and visualization of weather data in a website.<br/>
The specific weather data is used to analyze how weather changes as we get closer to the equator.<br/>
All website components must created. Tools used: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Jupyter Notebook, csv files.

### Objectives:

**1. Data**<br/>
The data is pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API to include 500 cities from around the globe, their coordinates, data on cloudiness, humidity, temperatures, and wind speed at their locations.

**2. Visualization**<br/>
Plotting of weather data in four graphs:<br/>
-Humidity<br/>
-Maximum Temperature<br/>
-Cloudiness<br/>
-Wind Speed<br/>
(see below visualization example: Humidity)

**3. Analysis**<br/>
Based on the four graphs, what conclusions can be drawn for the effects of all four factors on the weather as one moves closer to the equator?

### Analysis Summary:
How do weather factors change at locations as they are closer to the equator:<br/>
a) *Maximum Temperature:* Positive correlation (temperatures become significantly warmer as one approaches equator)<br/>
b) *Humidity:* No measurable correlation (level of humidity is distributed evenly across latitudes)<br/>
c) *Cloudiness:* No measurable correlation (data is scattered at all levels of latitude)<br/>
d) *Wind Speed:* No measurable correlation (graph suggests no higher concentration of higher wind speed around the equator)<br/>
